Things that are known not to be working in the Ludwig/C++ port.

1. Kleene '+' is not working correctly in regexes.  Currently the
   command \G`+N` will only match one digit at a time, even for
   consecutive digits.

   2018-06-10 This is now fixed.  Block indentation issue in
   pattern_add_dfa in dfa.cpp caused transition not to be added when the
   equivalence set was already in the dfa_table.

2. I'm pretty sure that numeric quantifiers will not work correctly, but
   I have not done any significant testing.  The main issue, I think, is
   that "pattern_getnumb(...)" (currently a lambda inside
   "pattern_parser(...)" in the C++ port) should take the "int number"
   parameter by reference to that callers can actually use the value.
   This seems to be a problem in the original pascal version also, as
   far as I can tell.

   2018-06-10 This is now fixed.  Number is now taken by reference, and
   other necessary tweaks to code made to support this.
