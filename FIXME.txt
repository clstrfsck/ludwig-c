Things that are known not to be working in the Ludwig/C++ port.

1. Kleene '+' is not working correctly in regexes.  Currently the
   command \G`+N` will only match one digit at a time, even for
   consecutive digits.

   2018-06-10 This is now fixed.  Block indentation issue in
   pattern_add_dfa in dfa.cpp caused transition not to be added when the
   equivalence set was already in the dfa_table.

2. I'm pretty sure that numeric quantifiers will not work correctly, but
   I have not done any significant testing.  The main issue, I think, is
   that "pattern_getnumb(...)" (currently a lambda inside
   "pattern_parser(...)" in the C++ port) should take the "int number"
   argument by reference so that callers can actually use the value.
   This seems to be a problem in the original pascal version also, as
   far as I can tell.

   2018-06-10 This is now fixed.  Argument number is now taken by
   reference, and other necessary tweaks to code made to support this.

3. J command doesn't seem to set equals mark.  For example, using
   command sequence '9J=J' does not return dot to it's original column.

   2018-06-10 This is now fixed.  Some transcription issues with Pascal
   "with" statements resulted in the equalaction "eqold" being a no-op.
   Other equalaction logic was potentially broken for commands that
   switch frames also. This has all been corrected.

4. A. Kennington reports that a .ludwigrc file containing the command
   ep'$t=(5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,80)'
   fails with an error "Illegal parameter delimiter".

   2018-06-11 This is now fixed.  Initialisation of PUNCT in code.cpp at
   startup was dependent on printable_set et al being initialised, but
   this initialisation did not occur until setup_initial_values() had
   been called.  Further investigation showed a similar issue in
   frame.cpp with NPUNCT.  The code was reworked to make PRINTABLE_SET
   and friends const (and upper case) and initialised on construction.
   As initialisation order of global vars is not defined across
   compilation units, access to PUNCT and NPUNCT is through a function
   which returns a reference to a static.
